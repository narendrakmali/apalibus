/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for the Traverse application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a user-ownership model for user profiles and an existence-based role check for admins.  It also uses denormalization to avoid costly `get()` calls, making authorization checks efficient.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}:  Stores user profile data. Access is restricted to the user themselves.
 * - /bus_operators/{operatorId}: Stores information about bus operators.
 * - /buses/{busId}: Contains details about individual buses. Includes denormalized `operatorId` for authorization independence.
 * - /bookings/{bookingId}: Stores booking information. Includes denormalized `userId` and `operatorId` for authorization independence.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: Indicates admin privileges based on document existence.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read/write their own profile data under /users/{userId}.
 * - Listing of users is disallowed.
 * - Admin privileges are determined by the existence of a document in /roles_admin/{userId}, eliminating the need to inspect document content.
 * - The rules explicitly deny operations that are not permitted to provide a clear security posture.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * - The /buses/{busId} collection denormalizes the `operatorId` to allow direct authorization checks without requiring additional reads.
 * - The /bookings/{bookingId} collection denormalizes both `userId` and `operatorId` for similar reasons.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * - Admin roles are stored in a separate /roles_admin/{userId} collection. This simplifies the security rules and clearly separates admin privileges from user data.
